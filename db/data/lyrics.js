    Lyrics:
      "Oh I've been traveling on a boat and a plane   /  In a car on a bike with a bus and a train   /  Traveling there and traveling here   /  Everywhere in every gear   /    But oh Lord we pay the price with a   /  Spin of a wheel with the roll of a dice   /  Ah yeah you pay your fare   /  And if you don't know where you're going   /  Any road will take you there   /    And I've been traveling through the dirt and the grime   /  From the past to the future through the space and the time   /  Traveling deep beneath the waves   /  In wattery grottoes and mountainous caves   /    But oh Lord we've got to fight   /  With the thoughts in the head with the dark and the light   /  No use to stop and stare   /  And if you don't know where you're going   /  Any road will take you there   /    You may not know where you came from   /  May not know who you are   /  May not even wondered how   /  You got this far   /    I've been traveling on a wing and a prayer   /  By the skin of my teeth by the breadth of a hair   /  Traveling where the four winds blow   /  With the sun on my face, in the ice and the snow   /    But ooee it's a game   /  Sometimes you're cool, sometimes you're lame   /  Ah yea it's somewhere   /  And if you don't know where you're going   /  Any road will take you there   /    But oh Lord we pay the price   /  With the spin of a wheel, with the roll of a dice   /  Ah yea, you pay your fare   /  And if you don't know where you're going   /  Any road will take you there   /    I keep traveling around the bend   /  There was no beginning, there is no end   /  It wasn't born and never dies   /  There are no edges, there is no sides   /  Oh yea, you just don't win   /  It's so far out - the way out is in   /  Bow to God and call him Sir   /    But if you don't know where you're going   /  Any road will take you there",

    Song: 'Distractions',
    Lyrics:
      "What is this thing in life that persuades me to spend   /  Time away from you?   /  If you can answer this you can have the moon.   /  This is the place to be, anyway you can see   /  There's a lovely view.   /  Why are there always so many other things to do?   /  Distractions, like butterflies are buzzing 'round my head,   /  When I'm alone I think of you   /  And the life we'd lead if we could only be free   /  From these distractions.   /    The postman's at the door   /  While the telephone rings on the kitchen wall,   /  Pretend we're not at home and they'll disappear.   /  I want to be with you, tell me what I can do,   /  Nothing is too small   /  Away from all this jazz we could do anything at all.   /  Distractions, like butterflies are buzzing 'round my head.   /  When I'm alone I think of you   /  And the things we'd do if we could only be through   /  With these distractions.   /  I'll fond the peaceful place far a way from the noise of a busy   /  Day   /  Where we can spend our nights counting shooting stars,   /  Distractions, like butterflies are buzzing 'round my head.   /  When I'm alone I think of you   /  And the things we'd do if we could only be through   /  With these distractions, like butterflies they're   /  Buzzing 'round my head, when I'm alone I think of you   /  And the life we'd lead if we could only be free   /  From these distractions.",

      "Burn the midnight lamp   /  Down until the dawn,   /  I'll keep watch until I'm sure your coming home.   /  Shadows play and flicker on the bedroom wall   /  They turn into a bad dream overnight,   /  Something could be terribly wrong.   /    Don't be careless love,   /  Don't be careless love,   /  Don't be, don't be careless.   /    In my dream you're running nowhere   /  Every step you've taken turns to glue,   /  Walking down a spiral staircase   /  Failing through, failing through,   /    Don't be careless love,   /  Be careless love.   /    The lamp burns down and out   /  I'm getting pretty tired of this,   /  I feel so bad something might be going amiss,   /    I won't be there so look out for yourself   /  You're getting in deep whatever you do,   /  Don't let me go back to sleep,   /    Don't be careless love,   /  Don't be careless love,   /  Don't be, don't be careless.   /    Saw your face in the morning paper,   /  Saw your body rolled up in a rug   /  Chopped up into two little pieces   /  By some thug,   /    Don't be careless love,   /  Be careless love.   /  But in the morning light   /  When I wake up again   /  You're by my side and that's the way it's always been,   /  But in the dark your mind plays funny tricks on you,   /  Your mind plays funny tricks on you,   /  Your mind plays funny tricks on you,   /    Don't be careless love",

    Lyrics:
      "You day breaks, your mind aches   /  You find that all her words   /  of kindness linger on   /  When she no longer needs you   /  She wakes up, she makes up   /  She takes her time and doesn't   /  feel she has to hurry   /  She no longer needs you   /    And in her eyes, you see nothing   /  No sign of live behind the tears   /  Cried for no one   /  A love that should have lasted years   /    You want her, you need her   /  And yet you don't believe her   /  When she says her love is dead   /  You think she needs you   /    And in her eyes, you see nothing   /  No sign of live behind the tears   /  Cried for no one   /  A love that should have lasted years   /    You stay home, she goes out   /  She says that long ago she knew someone   /  but now he's gone   /  She doesn't need him   /  your day breaks, your mind aches   /  There will be times when all the things   /  she said will fill your head   /  You won't forget her   /    And in her eyes, you see nothing   /  No sign of live behind the tears   /  Cried for no one   /  A love that should have lasted years",
